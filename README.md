# Ka Hou Sio's Personal Website
This project is about creating a personal website for people to view my projects, blogs, code and contacts.

## Introduction
In this project, I want to build a personal website to hold all my professional materials including data science project, blogs and etc. to one place for people to access easily. 

This website is built on top of a template from [HTML5 UP](https://html5up.net) and some of the pictures credits to [Upsplash](https://unsplash.com). 

## Getting Started
* `assets` - is where the CSS and other styling materials located at.
* `images` - contains all the images used for the website.
* files ending with .html are the html of the page.

This is Massively, a text-heavy, article-oriented design built around a huge background
image (with a new parallax implementation I'm testing) and scroll effects (powered by
Scrollex). A *slight* departure from all the one-pagers I've been doing lately, but one
that fulfills a few user requests and makes use of some new techniques I've been wanting
to try out. Enjoy it :)
